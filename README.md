## Letterpad Client - Theme

Letterpad client is responsible to display data from the Letterpad API.

It is responsible for displaying the below content.

- Home Page (collection of posts or a page)
- Single Page
- Single Post
- Tag (collection of posts)
- Preview (preview of a published/unpublished page or post)

This is a react based client developed with nextjs.

> You may choose to develop the client with any language of your choice.

To minimise the boilerplate and making it highly performant, it does not use many libraries. Since the Letterpad API is graphql, it uses `graphql` and `graphql-tag`.

Letterpad Dashboard is a multi-author dashboard, meaning one installation of Letterpad and serve multiple authors. In order to fetch the data for the appropriate author, a `clientId` is requried to be set in the `Authorization` header for every request.

```
 Authorization: `Basic ${process.env.CLIENT_ID}`,
```
